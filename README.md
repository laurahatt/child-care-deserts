# Child Care Deserts in Chicago’s Lakeview Neighborhood

### I. Defining Access to Child Care

Do families in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood have adequate access to child care?

Child care access is a multi-faceted concept. In 2017, an expert working group offered this definition: “Access to early care and education means that parents, with reasonable effort and affordability, can enroll their child in an arrangement that supports the child’s development and meets the parents’ needs.”[^1] This definition of access can be broken down into numerous dimensions and sub-dimensions. 

Consider, for instance, the dimension of “reasonable effort”. Researchers consider child care to be accessible with reasonable effort if age-appropriate child care slots are available near parents’ homes or work and information about those slots is readily available. This definition incorporates at least four sub-dimensions: the availability of slots relative to children in need of care, the geographic location of providers, the ages of children served by each provider, and the availability of information about those providers.[^2]

In theory, a study of child care access in a particular region might examine every relevant dimension and sub-dimension. In practice, however, a single study usually examines just a few elements. According to one literature review, the most commonly studied sub-dimension of child care access is child care slot availability, which is usually assessed based on estimates of supply, demand, and/or utilization. Researchers also frequently studied access in terms of provider type, geographic location, care quality, and the availability of subsidies, among other concepts.[^3]

This analysis defines child care access in terms of availability and location. This is a very common way of measuring child care access; after all, spatial proximity to an available amenity is a necessary (though of course not sufficient) component of access.  Figure 1, below, locates this narrow approach within a fuller conceptualization of child care access. Factors not incorporated within this analysis are shown in gray.
