# Child Care Deserts in Chicago’s Lakeview Neighborhood

## Research Question

Do families in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood have adequate access to child care?

### Introduction

#### I. Defining Access to Child Care

Child care access is a multi-faceted concept. In 2017, an expert working group offered this definition: “Access to early care and education means that parents, with reasonable effort and affordability, can enroll their child in an arrangement that supports the child’s development and meets the parents’ needs.”[^1] This definition of access can be broken down into numerous dimensions and sub-dimensions. 

Consider, for instance, the dimension of “reasonable effort”. Researchers consider child care to be accessible with reasonable effort if age-appropriate child care slots are available near parents’ homes or work and information about those slots is readily available. This definition incorporates at least four sub-dimensions: the availability of slots relative to children in need of care, the geographic location of providers, the ages of children served by each provider, and the availability of information about those providers.[^2]

In theory, a study of child care access in a particular region might examine every relevant dimension and sub-dimension. In practice, however, a single study usually examines just a few elements. According to one literature review, the most commonly studied sub-dimension of child care access is child care slot availability, which is usually assessed based on estimates of supply, demand, and/or utilization. Researchers also frequently studied access in terms of provider type, geographic location, care quality, and the availability of subsidies, among other concepts.[^3]

This analysis defines child care access in terms of availability and location. This is a very common way of measuring child care access; after all, spatial proximity to an available amenity is a necessary (though of course not sufficient) component of access.  The concept map below locates this narrow approach within a fuller conceptualization of child care access. Factors not incorporated within this analysis are shown in gray.

#### II. Operationalizing Availability

This analysis measures child care availability in terms of supply and demand. It estimates supply of child care based on the maximum capacity of all licensed daycare providers in a given area.[^4] It estimates demand for child care based on the number of families with children under six years old in a given area.[^5] Finally, it divides the number of slots hypothetically available to a family by the number of children hypothetically competing for those slots, producing a “slots per tot” ratio. The “slots per tot” ratio is a common measure of child care availability, although different studies calculate it in a host of different ways.[^6]

#### III. Operationalizing Proximity

This analysis measures child care availability based on the spatial proximity of providers to a family’s home, using a simplified version of the “two-stage floating catchment area” (2SFCA) approach. 

A different but common approach is to estimate access within a specific area or region. Usually, this area is an administrative unit such as a county or a census block group. Researchers taking this area-based approach estimate some measure of access for the entire area.[^7] For example: An area-based analysis of child care availability in Lakeview might find that there are X child care slots, Y children, and Z “slots per tot” in the community area. Unfortunately, this approach does not account for the reality that families frequently cross administrative boundaries to access care. 

In contrast, the 2SFCA approach generates a personalized measure of access for every family. As the name suggests, this approach involves two stages. First, the analyst estimates the slots per tot at a particular provider, based on the number of children living within that provider’s catchment area. Second, the analyst estimates the total slots per tot available to each individual family, based on the slots per tot at all providers in that family’s catchment area. This approach generates many spatially-located estimates of child care access - one for each family.[^8] These points can be summarized, mapped, and interpolated.

Researchers are increasingly using the 2SFCA approach to model child care access, when data allows. The Center for American Progress, for example, uses a version of the approach to power its interactive map of U.S. child care deserts.[^9]

  [^4]: Note that this is an imperfect indicator of child care supply. First: Many families obtain child care from providers other than licensed, private daycares. For instance, families may arrange some or all care through relative providers, license-exempt providers, public programs like Head Start, Early Head Start, or public preschool, and/or other sources. Second: Not all licensed daycare slots are available to all families, due to a host of obstacles to access such as provider age restrictions, cost, subsidy acceptance, language. As a result, the list of licensed daycare providers is likely an under-estimate of the full supply of child care available to a family.
  [^5]: Note that this is an imperfect indicator of child care demand. First: Many families with young children are not seeking licensed daycare. Second: Some families seeking licensed daycare may not compete for a given slot, due to family preferences and/or obstacles to access. As a result, the number of families with young children is likely an over-estimate of the full demand for child care.
